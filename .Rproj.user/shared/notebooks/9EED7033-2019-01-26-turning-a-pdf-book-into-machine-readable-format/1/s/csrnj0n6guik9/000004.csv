in college, it was much the same: volunteering as a photographer on an archae-
ological dig in Hawaii; teaching in a high school enrichment program for mi-
nority kids; traveling in urope. The closest thing to an ordinary paying job |
ever had was occasionally selling hot dogs at football games in my freshman year
in college. What is more, the ivory towers that [ have inhabited since the mid-
1960s have been located in beautiful physical settings, filled with congenial and
interesting colleagues and students, and animated by exciting ideas. This, then,
is the first fundamental fact of my life as an academic: [ have been extraordinar-
ily lucky and have always lived what can only be considered a life of extreme priv-
ilege. Nearly all of the time [ am doing what [ want to do; what I do gives me a
sense of fulfillment and purpose; and | am paid well for doing it.

Here is the second fundamental fact of my academic life: since the early
19708, my intellectual life has been firmly anchored in the Marxist tradition. The
core of my teaching as a professor has centered on communicating the central
ideas and debates of contemporary Marxism and allied traditions of emancipa-
tory social theory. The courses I have taught have had names like Class, State and
Ideology: An Introduction to Marxist Sociology; Envisioning Real Utopias; Mars-
ist Theories of the State; Alternative Foundations of Class Analysis. My energies
in institution building have all involved creating and expanding arenas within
which radical system-challenging ideas could flourish: creating a graduate pro-
gram in class analysis and historical change in the Sociology Department at the
University of Wisconsinâ€”Madison; establishing the A. E. Havens Center, a re-
search institute for critical scholarship at Wisconsin; organizing an annual con-
ference for activists and academics, now called RadFest, which has been held
every year since 1983. And my scholarship has been primarily devoted to recon-
structing Marxism as a theoretical framework and research tradition. While the
substantive preoccupations of this scholarship have shifted over the past thirty
years, its central mission has not.

As in any biography, this pair of facts is the result of a trajectory of circum-
stances and choices: circumstances that formed me and shaped the range of
choices I encountered, and choices that in turn shaped my future circumstances.
Some of these choices were made easily, with relatively little weighing of alter-
natives, sometimes even without much awareness that a choice was actually be-
ing made; others were the result of protracted reflection and conscious decision
making, sometimes with the explicit understanding that the choice being made
would constrain possible choices in the future. Six such junctures of circum-
stance and choice seem especially important to me in shaping the contours of
my academic career. â€˜The first was posed incrementally in the early 1970s: the
choice to identify my work primarily as contributing to Marxism rather than
simply using Marxism. The second concerns the choice, made just before grad-
uate school at the University of California, Berkeley, to be a sociologist, rather
than some other ist. â€˜The third was the choice to become what some people de-
scribe as multivariate Marxist: to be a Marxist sociologist who engages in grandi-
ose, perhaps overblown, quantitative research, The fourth choice was the choice
of which academic department to be in. This choice was acutely posed to me
in 1987 when I spent a year as a visiting professor at the University of Califor-
nia, Berkeley. | had been offered a position there, and | had to decide whether
I wanted to return to Wisconsin. Returning to Madison was unquestionably a
choice that shaped subsequent contexts of choice. The fifth choice has been
posed and reposed to me with increasing intensity since the late 1980s: the
choice to stay a Marxist in this world of post-Marxisms when many of my intel-
lectual comrades have decided for various good, and sometimes perhaps not so
good, reasons to recast their intellectual agenda as being perhaps friendly to, but
outside of, the Marxist tradition. Finally, the sixth important choice was to shift
my central academic work from the study of class structure to the problem of en-
visioning real utopias.

To set the stage for this reflection on choice and constraint, I need to give a
brief account of the circumstances of my life that brought me into the arena of
these choices.

Growing Up

I was born in Berkeley, California, in 1947 while my father, who had received a
PhD in psychology before World War II, was in medical school on the GI Bill.
When he finished his medical training in 1951, we moved to Lawrence, Kansas,
where he became the head of the program in clinical psychology at Kansas Uni-
versity (KU) and a professor of psychiatry in the KU Medical School. Because of
antinepotism rules at the time, my mother, who also had a PhD in psychology,
was not allowed to be employed at the university, so throughout the 1950s she did
research on various research grants. In 1961, when the state law on such things
changed, she became a professor of rehabilitation psychology.

Life in my family was intensely intellectual. Dinner table conversation would
often revolve around intellectual matters, and my parents were always deeply en-
