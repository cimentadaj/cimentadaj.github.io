"1","thusiastic and involved in their children’s school projects and intellectual pur-
suits. My mother would carefully go over term papers with each of us, giving us
both editorial advice and substantive suggestions. We were members of the Law-
rence Unitarian Fellowship, which was made up of, to a substantial extent, uni-
versity families. Sunday morning services were basically interdisciplinary semi-
nars on matters of philosophical and social concern; Sunday school was an
extended curriculum on world religions. | knew by about age ten that | wanted
to be a professor. Both of my parents were academics. Both of my siblings be-
came academics. Both of their spouses are academics. (Only my wife, a clinical
psychologist, is not an academic, although her father was a professor.) ‘The only
social mobility in my family was interdepartmental. It just felt natural to go into
the family business.

Lawrence was a delightful, easy place to grow up. Although Kansas was a po-
litically conservative state, Lawrence was a vibrant, liberal community. My ear-
liest form of political activism centered on religion: | was an active member of a
Unitarian youth group called Liberal Religious Youth, and in high school { went
out of my way to argue with Bible Belt Christians about their belief in God. The
early 1960s also witnessed my earliest engagement with social activism. The civil
rights movement came to Lawrence first in the form of an organized boycott of
a local segregated swimming pool in the 1950s and then in the form of civil rights
rallies in the 1960s. In 1963 I went to the Civil Rights March on Washington and
heard Martin Luther King Jr’s “I have a dream” speech. My earliest sense of pol-
itics was that at its core it was about moral questions of social justice, not prob-
lems of economic power and interests.

My family, also, was liberal, supporting the civil rights movement and other
liberal causes; but while the family culture encouraged an intellectual interest in
social and moral concerns, it was not intensely political. We would often talk
about values, and the Unitarian Fellowship we attended also stressed humanis-
tic, socially concerned values, but these were mostly framed as matters of indi-
vidual responsibility and morality not as the grounding of a coherent political
challenge to social injustice. My only real exposure toa more radical political per-
spective came through my maternal grandparents, Russian Jewish immigrants
who had come to the United States before World War I and lived near us in Law-
rence, and my mother’s sister’s family in New York. Although I was not aware of
this at the time, my grandparents and the New York relatives were Communists.
This was never openly talked about, but from time to time I would hear glowing
things said about the Soviet Union, socialism would be held out as an ideal, and
America and capitalism would be criticized in emotionally laden ways. My cous-
ins in New York were especially vocal about this, and in the mid-1g60s when I be-
came more engaged in political matters, intense political discussions with my
New York relatives contributed significantly to anchoring my radical sensibilities.

My interest in social sciences began in earnest in high school. fn Lawrence it
was easy for academically oriented kids to take courses at the University of Kan-
sas, and in my senior year | took a political science course on American politics.
For my term project | decided to do a survey of children’s attitudes toward the
American presidency and got permission to administer a questionnaire to several
hundred students from grades 1-12 in the public schools. | then organized a party
with my friends to code the data and produce graphs of how various attitudes
changed by age. I'he most striking finding was that, in response to the question,
“Would you like to be President of the United States when you grow up?” there
were more girls who said yes than boys through third grade, after which the rate
for girls declined dramatically.

By the time I graduated from high school in 1964, I had enough university
credits and advanced placement credits to enter KU as a second-semester soph-
omore, and that is what | had planned to do. Nearly all of my friends were going
to KU. It just seemed like the thing to do. A friend of my parents, Karl Heider,
gave me, as a Christmas present in my senior year in high school, an application
form to Harvard. He was a graduate student at Harvard in anthropology at the
time. I filled it out and sent it in. Harvard was the only place to which I applied,
not out of inflated self-confidence but because it was the only application I got as
a Christmas present. When | eventually was accepted (initially I was on the wait-
ing list), the choice was thus between KU and Harvard. I suppose this was a
“choice” since I could have decided to stay at KU. However, it just seemed so ob-
vious; there was no angst, no weighing of alternatives, no thinking about the pros
and cons. Thus, going to Harvard in a way just happened.

Like many students who began university in the mid-1960s, my political ideas
were rapidly radicalized as the Viet Nam War escalated and began to impinge on
our lives. I was not a student leader in activist politics, but I did actively partici-
pate in demonstrations, rallies, fasts for peace, and endless political debate. At
Harvard I majored in social studies, an intense interdisciplinary social science
major centering on the classics of social theory, and in that program I was first ex-
posed to the more abstract theoretical issues that bore on the political concerns
of the day: the dynamics of capitalism, the nature of power and domination, the
importance of elites in shaping American foreign policy, and the problem of
