Erik Olin Wright received his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley, and
has taught at the University of Wisconsin since then. His academic work has been
centrally concerned with reconstructing the Marxist tradition of social theory and
research in ways that attempt to make it more relevant to contemporary concerns
and more cogent as a scientific framework of analysis. His empirical research has
focused especially on the changing character of class relations in developed capi-
talist societies. Since 1992 he has directed the Real Utopias Project, which explores
a range of proposals for new institutional designs that embody emancipatory ideals
and yet are attentive to issues of pragmatic feasibility. His principle publications
include The Politics of Punishment: A Critical Analysis of Prisons in America;
Class, Crisis and the State; Classes; Reconstructing Marxism (with Elliott Sober
and Andrew Levine); Interrogating Inequality; Class Counts: Comparative Stud-
ies in Class Analysis; and Deepening Democracy: Innovations in Empowered
Participatory Governance (with Archon Fung). He is married to Marcia Kahn
Wright, a clinical psychologist working in community mental health, and has tvo
grown daughters, Jennifer and Rebecca.

[ have been in school continuously for more than fifty vears: since I entered
kindergarten in 1952, there has never been a September when I wasn’t beginning
a school year. | have never held a nine-to-five job with fixed hours and a boss
telling me what to do. In high school, my summers were always spent in vari-
ous kinds of interesting and engaging activities — traveling home from Australia
where my family spent a year (my parents were Fulbright professors at the Uni-
versity of Western Australia); music camp (1 played viola); assisting in a lab. And
in college, it was much the same: volunteering as a photographer on an archae-
ological dig in Hawaii; teaching in a high school enrichment program for mi-
nority kids; traveling in urope. The closest thing to an ordinary paying job |
ever had was occasionally selling hot dogs at football games in my freshman year
in college. What is more, the ivory towers that [ have inhabited since the mid-
1960s have been located in beautiful physical settings, filled with congenial and
interesting colleagues and students, and animated by exciting ideas. This, then,
is the first fundamental fact of my life as an academic: [ have been extraordinar-
ily lucky and have always lived what can only be considered a life of extreme priv-
ilege. Nearly all of the time [ am doing what [ want to do; what I do gives me a
sense of fulfillment and purpose; and | am paid well for doing it.

Here is the second fundamental fact of my academic life: since the early
19708, my intellectual life has been firmly anchored in the Marxist tradition. The
core of my teaching as a professor has centered on communicating the central
ideas and debates of contemporary Marxism and allied traditions of emancipa-
tory social theory. The courses I have taught have had names like Class, State and
Ideology: An Introduction to Marxist Sociology; Envisioning Real Utopias; Mars-
ist Theories of the State; Alternative Foundations of Class Analysis. My energies
in institution building have all involved creating and expanding arenas within
which radical system-challenging ideas could flourish: creating a graduate pro-
gram in class analysis and historical change in the Sociology Department at the
University of Wisconsin—Madison; establishing the A. E. Havens Center, a re-
search institute for critical scholarship at Wisconsin; organizing an annual con-
ference for activists and academics, now called RadFest, which has been held
every year since 1983. And my scholarship has been primarily devoted to recon-
structing Marxism as a theoretical framework and research tradition. While the
substantive preoccupations of this scholarship have shifted over the past thirty
years, its central mission has not.

As in any biography, this pair of facts is the result of a trajectory of circum-
stances and choices: circumstances that formed me and shaped the range of
choices I encountered, and choices that in turn shaped my future circumstances.
Some of these choices were made easily, with relatively little weighing of alter-
natives, sometimes even without much awareness that a choice was actually be-
ing made; others were the result of protracted reflection and conscious decision
making, sometimes with the explicit understanding that the choice being made
would constrain possible choices in the future. Six such junctures of circum-
stance and choice seem especially important to me in shaping the contours of
my academic career. ‘The first was posed incrementally in the early 1970s: the
choice to identify my work primarily as contributing to Marxism rather than
simply using Marxism. The second concerns the choice, made just before grad-
uate school at the University ..."
