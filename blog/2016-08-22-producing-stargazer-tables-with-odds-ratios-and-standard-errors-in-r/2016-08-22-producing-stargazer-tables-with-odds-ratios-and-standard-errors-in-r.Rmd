Whoa, what a day. I've been using the stargazer package for producing my (beautiful) regression tables in R for a while now. Among all the arguments of its main function (`stargazer()` ) are `apply.coef`,  `apply.se`,  `apply.ci`, â€¦ and so on for all the other statistics of a regression output. Each of these arguments, if specified, applies a function over the specified statistic. So, for calculating the odds ratios I would simply apply the `exp()` function over the set of log odds. It turns out that if you apply any function over the coefficients (or any other statistic), stargazer automatically recalculates t values with the new coefficients! This means that the significance of my model will depend on the new values and we surely wouldn't want that.

Let's show a reproducible example:

```{r}
# install.packages("stargazer") # in case you don't have this package
suppressMessages(library(stargazer))

m1 <- glm(mtcars$vs ~ mtcars$hp + mtcars$mpg)

stargazer(m1, type = "text") # Our standard log odds
stargazer(m1, apply.coef = exp, type = "text")
```

The coefficients are correct, but look at the significance levels! Those are some really undesirable results. I was actually using this for quite some time without noticing. In light of this problem I decided to create a small function that extracted the statistics separately and applied the appropriate conversion when needed. It's far from being a flexible function, but it can surely help you run some quick-and-dirty logistic regressions with odds ratios instead of log odds.

Here's the function and an example:

```{r}
stargazer2 <- function(model, odd.ratio = F, ...) {
  if(!("list" %in% class(model))) model <- list(model)
    
  if (odd.ratio) {
    coefOR2 <- lapply(model, function(x) exp(coef(x)))
    seOR2 <- lapply(model, function(x) exp(coef(x)) * summary(x)$coef[, 2])
    p2 <- lapply(model, function(x) summary(x)$coefficients[, 4])
    stargazer(model, coef = coefOR2, se = seOR2, p = p2, ...)
    
  } else {
    stargazer(model, ...)
  }
}

stargazer(m1, type = "text") # Our standard log odds
stargazer2(m1, odd.ratio = T, type = "text") 
# Now the coefficients and significance is correct!
```

```{r}
# You can also use lists
m1 <- glm(mtcars$vs ~ mtcars$mpg)
m2 <- glm(mtcars$vs ~ mtcars$mpg + mtcars$hp)
m3 <- glm(mtcars$vs ~ mtcars$mpg + mtcars$hp + mtcars$am)

models <- list(m1, m2, m3)

stargazer(models, type = "text")
stargazer2(models, odd.ratio = T, type = "text")
# Same significance but different coefficients and SE's
```

Caveats:

* It only accepts one model or one list containing several models. I did this because I didn't want to get into distinguishing between several separate models. If you want to improve it, [here's](https://github.com/cimentadaj/cimentadaj/blob/master/R/stargazer2.R) the Github website, submit a pull request!

* It doesn't calculate confidence intervals as the formula is more complicated and I didn't need them for now.

Update: I included this function in my personal package which you can install like this:
```{r, eval = F}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cimentadaj/cimentadaj")
```
