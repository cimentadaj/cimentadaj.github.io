Upon reading "How Not To Lie with Statistics: Avoiding Common Mistakes in Quantitative Political Science" from Gary King, I stumbled into a section which proved that t-tests, ANOVA and Linear Regression are intimately related, both conceptually and algebraically. As a late-comer in statistics, one usually does not pay attention to these nuances. I decided to make a short simulation in R just to make sure my intuition was right.

```{r}
set.seed(1)

income <- sample(1000:5000, 100, replace = T)
gender <- rep(c(1, 0), 50)
```

```{r}
t <- t.test(income ~ gender)
unname(t$estimate[2] - t$estimate[1])
```

```{r}
coef(model <- lm(income ~ gender))
```

```{r}
# The ANOVA model is actually computed through the lm
# call but we can use the anova() function to check if
# the differences are significant as well.

anova(model)
```

It's fun to find out about these things and prove that they make sense. However, the strength of linear models is that you can â€˜adjust' for other important variables and get an adjusted estimated difference. Let's add another variable called kids with the number of children per person and see how the difference changes.

```{r}
kids <- sample(1:4, 100, replace = T)
lm(income ~ gender + kids)
```

Well, we can now say that the difference in income between male and females is of about 200 adjusted for the number of children per person.
