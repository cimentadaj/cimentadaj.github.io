<p>Writing my thesis with <code>Sweave</code> and <code>knitr</code> was very nice at the beginning, but then I began running into problems when I wanted to combine different chapters into one single document. Most of the problems were related to having each chapter be compilable on its own with separate bibliographies, among other things. I wrote a detailed guide on how I did it and you can read it <a href="https://cimentadaj.github.io/phd_thesis/thesis_template_example/2017-10-24-thesis-template.html">here</a>. I’d love some feedback as workflow is still very rudimentary. You can post a comment on this post or email me at <a href="mailto:cimentadaj@gmail.com">cimentadaj@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>Hope it’s useful.</p>
