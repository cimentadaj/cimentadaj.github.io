I'm finishing a project from the RECSM institute where we developed a [Shiny application](https://essurvey.shinyapps.io/ess_castellano/) to download data from the European Social Survey with Spanish translated labels. This was one hell of a project since I had to build some wrappers around the Google Translate API to generate translations for over 1300 questions and stream line this to be interactive while users download the data. That's a long story which I will not delve into. 

This post is about a bug I found in the `haven` package while doing the project. The bug is simple to explain and [I filed it in `haven` already](https://github.com/tidyverse/haven/issues/435):

Let's define a labelled double with only one tagged NA value.

```{r}
library(haven)
#> Warning: package 'haven' was built under R version 3.4.4

tst <-
  labelled(
    c(
      1:5,
      tagged_na("d")
    ),
    c(
      "Agree Strongly" = 1,
      "Agree" = 2,
      "Neither agree nor disagree" = 3,
      "Disagree" = 4,
      "Disagree strongly" = 5,
      "No answer" = tagged_na("d")
    )
  )

tst


write_dta(data.frame(freehms = tst), "test.dta", version = 13)
```

If I load this in Stata and type tab freehms, all labels are correct:

Now, if I take the code above and add another tagged NA value, then `write_dta` drops the last label for some reason:

```{r}
library(haven)

tst <-
  labelled(c(1:5,
             tagged_na('d'),
             ## Only added this
             tagged_na('c')
          ),
        c('Agree Strongly' = 1,
          'Agree' = 2,
          'Neither agree nor disagree' = 3,
          'Disagree' = 4,
          'Disagree strongly' = 5,
          'No answer' = tagged_na('d'),
            ## And this
          'Dont know' = tagged_na('c')
          )
        )

tst

write_dta(data.frame(freehms = tst), "test.dta", version = 13)
```

Well, the bug is evident (notice the 5 without a label?). However, since the project is on a deadline I had to come up with a solution. It's very simple: avoid tagged NA's but recode them as traditional labels. Here's a solution:

```{r, message = FALSE, warnings = FALSE}
library(sjlabelled)
library(sjmisc)

# Labels tags present in the ESS data
old_label_names <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")

# Grab the labels with tagged NA's with a regex
na_available <- unname(gsub("NA|\\(|\\)", "", get_na(tst, TRUE)))

# Identify which of the existent labels are actually valid ESS missings
which_ones_use <- old_label_names %in% na_available

# Subset only the ones which need recoding
value_code <- c(666, 777, 888, 999)[which_ones_use]
new_label_names <- c(".a", ".b", ".c", ".d")[which_ones_use]

# Recode them
for (i in seq_along(na_available)) {
  tst <- replace_na(tst,
                    value = value_code[i],
                    na.label = new_label_names[i],
                    tagged.na = na_available[i]
                    )
}

tst
```

There we go. Those labels would clearly be interpreted as missings and Stata would read them as traditional labels (well, it's not perfect, but it's a workaround). What I did was wrap the above code into a function and apply it to all questions in all rounds (> 1300!).

```{r}
recode_stata_labels <- function(x) {
  # Labels tags present in the ESS data
  old_label_names <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")

  # Grab the labels with tagged NA's with a regex
  na_available <- unname(gsub("NA|\\(|\\)", "", get_na(x, TRUE)))

  # Identify which of the existent labels are actually valid ESS missings
  which_ones_use <- old_label_names %in% na_available

  # Subset only the ones which need recoding
  value_code <- c(666, 777, 888, 999)[which_ones_use]
  new_label_names <- c(".a", ".b", ".c", ".d")[which_ones_use]

  for (i in seq_along(na_available)) {
    x <- replace_na(x,
                    value = value_code[i],
                    na.label = new_label_names[i],
                    tagged.na = na_available[i]
    )
  }

  x
}
```

Now, what happens if a `labelled` class only has tagged NA's?

```{r}

tst <-
  labelled(c(1:5,
             tagged_na('d'),
             tagged_na('c')
             ),
           c('No answer' = tagged_na('d'), 'Dont know' = tagged_na('c')))

tst
```

```{r, error = TRUE}
recode_stata_labels(tst)
```

That's weird. I was in such a rush that I didn't really want to debug the source code in `haven`. However, I had the intuition that this was related to the fact that there were only tagged NA's as labels. How do I fixed it? Just add a toy label at the beginning of the function and remove it after the recoding.

```{r}
recode_stata_labels <- function(x) {
    # I add a random label (here) and delete it at the end (end of the function)
    x <- add_labels(x, labels = c('test' = 111111))

    # Note that this vector is in the same order as the `value_code` and `new_label_names`
    # because they're values correspond to each other in this order.
    old_label_names <- c("a", "b", "c", "d")

    na_available <- unname(gsub("NA|\\(|\\)", "", sjlabelled::get_na(x, TRUE)))
    which_ones_use <- old_label_names %in% na_available

    value_code <- c(666, 777, 888, 999)[which_ones_use]
    new_label_names <- c(".a", ".b", ".c", ".d")[which_ones_use]

    for (i in seq_along(na_available)) {
      x <- replace_na(x, value = value_code[i], na.label = new_label_names[i], tagged.na = na_available[i])
    }

    x <- remove_labels(x, labels = "test")

  x
}

recode_stata_labels(tst)
```

There we are. The `replace_na` function is actually doing most of the work and I found it extremely useful (comes from the `sjmisc` package).
