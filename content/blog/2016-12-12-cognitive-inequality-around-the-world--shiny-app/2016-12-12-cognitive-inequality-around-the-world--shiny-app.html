<p>For the last month I’ve been working on this massive dataset that combines all PISA, TIMSS and PIRLS surveys into one major database. It has over 3 million students and over 2,000 variables, including student background and school and teacher information. I started playing around with it and ending up doing this: <a href="https://cimentadaj.shinyapps.io/shiny/" class="uri">https://cimentadaj.shinyapps.io/shiny/</a>. Feel free to check it out and drop any comments below.</p>
<p>If you want to contribute, <a href="https://github.com/cimentadaj/Inequality_Shinyapp">this</a> is the Github repository. I plan to keep adding some stuff to the app, including new surveys and automatic plot downloading, so don’t forget to check it out.</p>
