<p>I was just browsing the web and found <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml/">this cool resource on ML from Google</a>. They’re not like you’re typical tutorial but rather bullet-point type questions with advice on what to do on certain scenarios. I just came up with the idea of an interesting series of posts where each of the questions outlined in the documents is accompanied with a concrete example that shows how it works under certain scenarios.</p>
<p>There’s also other tutorial on that website such as with <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/text-classification/">text classification</a>. This reminds me of the <a href="https://github.com/cimentadaj/info_to_read">list I keep of interesting blog posts/books/courses</a> I would to follow through in the future</p>
