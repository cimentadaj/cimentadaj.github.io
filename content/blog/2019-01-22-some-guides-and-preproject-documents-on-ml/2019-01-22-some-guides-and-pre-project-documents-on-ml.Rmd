I was just browsing the web and found [this cool resource on ML from Google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/rules-of-ml/). They're not like you're typical tutorial but rather bullet-point type questions with advice on what to do on certain scenarios. I just came up with the idea of an interesting series of posts where each of the questions outlined in the documents is accompanied with a concrete example that shows how it works under certain scenarios.

There's also other tutorial on that website such as with [text classification](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/guides/text-classification/). This reminds me of the [list I keep of interesting blog posts/books/courses](https://github.com/cimentadaj/info_to_read) I would to follow through in the future
