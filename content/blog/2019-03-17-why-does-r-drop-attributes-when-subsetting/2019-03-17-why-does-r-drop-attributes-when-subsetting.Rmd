I had to spend about 1 hour yesterday because R did something completely unpredictable (for my taste). It dropped an attribute without a warning.

```{r}

df <- data.frame(x = rep(c(1, 2), 20))

attr(df$x, "label") <- "This is clearly a label"

df$x
```

The label is clearly there. To my surprise, if I subset this data frame, R drops the attribute.

```{r}
new_df <- df[df$x == 2, , drop = FALSE]

new_df$x
```

It doesn't matter if it's using bracket subsetting (`[`) or `subset`.

```{r}
new_df <- subset(df, x == 2)

new_df$x
```

That's not good. R's dropping attributes silently. For my specific purpose I ended up using `dplyr::filter` which safely enough preserves attributes.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)

df %>% 
  filter(df, x == 2) %>% 
  pull(x)
```
