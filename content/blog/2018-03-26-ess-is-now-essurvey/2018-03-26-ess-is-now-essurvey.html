<p>My <code>ess</code> package has be renamed to <code>essurvey</code>. For quite some time I’ve been pondering whether I should change the name. All of this comes from a dicussion we had on the <a href="http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/R-pkgs-Release-of-ess-0-0-1-td4746540.html">R-pkg mailing list</a> where many R users suggested that the name was unfortunate given that Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) has a long precedence in the R community and the names are very similar. Later on, when submitting the package to <a href="https://ropensci.org/">rOpensci</a>, Jim Hester <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/201#issuecomment-372304003">raised the fact once again</a>, without being aware of the previous email thread.</p>
<p>Considering that I was already changing some of the functionalities of the package due to the <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/issues/201">rOpensci review</a>, I decided to change the package name and republish an improved version of <code>ess</code> as <code>essurvey 1.0.0</code>. <code>essurvey</code> is now on CRAN and the repository has been moved to rOpensci’s <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/essurvey">github account</a>.</p>
<p>The new package is mostly similar although there are now some deprecated functions and new features. Below are the main changes.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can login <strong>once</strong> using <code>set_email(&quot;your_email&quot;)</code> and avoid rewriting your email in every call to the <code>ess_*</code> functions.</p></li>
<li><p>All <code>ess_*</code> functions have been deprecated in favour of similar <code>import_*</code> functions. For example:</p></li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>ess_rounds(1:7)</code></pre>
<p>becomes..</p>
<pre class="r"><code>import_rounds(1:7)</code></pre>
<p>But that’s the same you would say. The only difference is that with <code>ess_rounds</code> you could download data in Stata, SPSS or SAS formats directly. For that, there’s now the <code>download_*</code> functions.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>download_rounds(
  1:5,
  output_dir = getwd(),
  format = &quot;spss&quot;
)</code></pre>
<p>All of the above applies to <code>ess_country</code> and the <code>ess_all_*</code> functions. There’s also some other minor changes you can checkout in the <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/essurvey/blob/master/NEWS.md">NEWS</a> file. If you haven’t tried <code>essurvey</code>, you can visit the package website for more detailed examples at <a href="https://ropensci.github.io/essurvey/" class="uri">https://ropensci.github.io/essurvey/</a>.</p>
