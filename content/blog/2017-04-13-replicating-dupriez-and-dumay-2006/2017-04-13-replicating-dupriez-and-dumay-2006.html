<p>So, I was bored for two days and decided I’d replicate a paper I had read. The paper is called ‘Inequalities in school systems: effect of school structure or of society structure?’ written by Vincent Dupriez and Xavier Dumay which you can read from <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03050060600628074?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true">here</a>. I made available two version, one in <a href="https://github.com/cimentadaj/Inequality_schools_replication/raw/master/replication_tracking_pisa.pdf">pdf</a> and another in <a href="https://cimentadaj.github.io/Inequality_schools_replication/replication_tracking_pisa.html">html</a>.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in looking at the code or suggesting some changes, do send me an email at <code>cimentadaj@gmail.com</code> or check the <a href="https://github.com/cimentadaj/Inequality_schools_replication">Github repository</a>.</p>
