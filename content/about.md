Hi, I’m Jorge Cimentada and I’m a Data Scientist at [Kernel Analytics](https://kernel-analytics.com/en/analytics/). I'm finishing my PhD candidacy in Sociology at Pompeu Fabra University and belong to the [Research and Expertise Centre for Survey Methodology (RECSM)](https://www.upf.edu/web/survey). My main research interests are the study of achievement inequality, population dynamics and inequality in spatial segregation/mobility. I enjoy programming with R, scraping data and applying statistics, machine learning and data science to help people. If this matches your profile, let's work on something together!

I am very passionate about statistical programming with R, machine learning, data visualization, statistics and drums.

If you wish to contact me send me an email to `cimentadaj (at) gmail (dot) com`. I’m also on [Github](https://github.com/cimentadaj) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorge-cimentada-1740877a/).
