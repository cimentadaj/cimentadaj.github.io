Hi, I’m Jorge Cimentada and I’m a PhD candidate in Sociology at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, Spain. I belong to the [Research and Expertise Centre for Survey Methodology (RECSM)](https://www.upf.edu/web/survey) and my main research interests are the study of achievement inequality, the role of schools in reproducing these inequalities and early education as a remedy to achievement inequalities. I’m currently working at the [Research and Expertise Centre for Survey Methodology (RECSM)](https://www.upf.edu/web/survey) as an R developer and Data Scientists. Previously I worked on a project related to class mobility and how it has changed over time in industrialized countries in the [DEMOSOC](https://www.upf.edu/web/demosoc) research group.

I am very passionate about statistical programming with R , data visualization, statistics and drums. **I've started making a transition from academia to the private sector to work as a Data Scientist**. If you feel that I'd be a good match for your company, let's talk!

If you wish to contact me send me an email to `cimentadaj@gmail.com`. I’m also on [Github](https://github.com/cimentadaj) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorge-cimentada-1740877a/).
