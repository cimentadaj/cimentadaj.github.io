Hi! I’m Jorge Cimentada, Senior Data Scientist at eDreams Odigeo and a Professor at [University Charles III of Madrid](https://www.uc3m.es/master/computational-social-science). I’ve worked in data science ever since I earned a PhD in Social Sciences in 2019 where I used computational methods to understand inequality in educational systems. I also like to build open source tools for data wrangling, data science and more broadly machine learning.
If you’d like to learn more about what I do, have a look at some of my projects or courses:

* [Open source software](https://github.com/cimentadaj) related to statistical estimations, API wrappers, data acquisition.
* I’ve taught many courses over the years, two of them are on [Machine Learning](https://cimentadaj.github.io/ml_socsci/) and [Data Harvesting](https://cimentadaj.github.io/dataharvesting/index.html).
* I regularly do consulting work related to machine learning and statistical software development. Some of my work includes the [United Nations Population Division](https://population.un.org/wpp/) and the [Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research](https://timriffe.github.io/DemoTools/).
* For CV related things check out my [linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorge-cimentada-1740877a/).

Outside of my work life, I have a band called [YEITUEI](https://www.instagram.com/yeituei/) where I play drums.
