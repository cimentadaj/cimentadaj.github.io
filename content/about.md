Hi, I'm Jorge Cimentada, a Research Scientist working at the Laboratory of
Digital and Computational Demography at the [Max Planck Institute for
Demographic Resarch](https://www.demogr.mpg.de/en/). I have a PhD in Sociology
from Pompeu Fabra University and belong to the [Research and Expertise Centre
for Survey Methodology (RECSM)](https://www.upf.edu/web/survey). My main
research interests are the study of achievement inequality, population dynamics
and inequality in spatial segregation/mobility. I enjoy programming with R,
scraping data and applying statistics, machine learning and data science to help
people. If this matches your profile, let's work on something together!

I am very passionate about statistical programming with R, machine learning,
data visualization, statistics and drums.

If you wish to contact me send me an email to `cimentadaj (at) gmail (dot)
com`. Iâ€™m also on [Github](https://github.com/cimentadaj) and
[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jorge-cimentada-1740877a/).
