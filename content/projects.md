<p>In this section you can find bits of material I've written over time and some of my personal projects, mainly concentrated on the R programming software<p>

<b> Data science </b>

[How long should I wait for my bike?](blog/2018-02-12-what-time-should-i-ride-my-bike/what-time-should-i-ride-my-bike/index.html): This is a series of posts (currently active) in which I set up a private server and interact with the Barcelona public bicycle system API. I've performed analysis of waiting times and I plan to add a live predictive model of waiting time for stations.


[Analyzing "How I Met Your Mother"](blog/2017-10-16-scraping-and-visualizing-how-i-met-your-mother/scraping-and-visualizing-how-i-met-your-mother/index.html): In this blog post I scraped and analyzed the scripts of the American TV series "How I Met Your Mother".

<b> R packages </b>

perccalc ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/perccalc/index.html), [Github](https://github.com/cimentadaj/perccalc)): An implementation of two functions that estimate values for percentiles from an ordered categorical variable as described by Reardon (2011, isbn:978-0-87154-372-1).

essurvey ([CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/essurvey/index.html), [Github](https://github.com/ropensci/essurvey), [Pkg website](https://ropensci.github.io/essurvey/)): Download data from the European Social Survey directly into R from their website http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/.

cimentadaj ([Github](https://github.com/cimentadaj/cimentadaj)): My personal package

<b> Miscellaneous </b>

[My PISA twitter bot](blog/2017-03-08-my-pisa-twitter-bot/my-pisa-twitter-bot/index.html): I programmed a Twitter bot that tweets graphs from the [PISA](http://www.oecd.org/pisa/) database. How did I do it? See [here](blog/2017-03-08-my-pisa-twitter-bot/my-pisa-twitter-bot/index.html) and follow [@DailyPISA_Facts](https://twitter.com/DailyPISA_Facts)

[Educational Inequality around the world](https://cimentadaj.shinyapps.io/shiny/): Visualize educational inequality for over 70 countries from 2000 to 2015 using this Shinyapp.

I completed all solutions to the [R for Data Science book](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). Solutions can be found [here](https://github.com/cimentadaj/R4DS-Solutions)

I translated some Stata code to R for the <a href = "https://www.povertyactionlab.org/" target = "_blank"> The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) </a> and was featured on their <a href = "https://www.povertyactionlab.org/research-resources/software-and-tools" target = "_blank"> website</a>.


<b> Teaching R </b>

- In April 2016, together with <a href = "https://sites.google.com/site/brunoarpino/" target = "_blank">Bruno Arpino</a> and some colleagues from the <a href = "https://www.upf.edu/survey/" target = "_blank"> RECSM</a>, I organized a seminar series introducing  R at Pompeu Fabra University. As part of the lectures I programmed some interactive lessons which can help get you started. These lessons assume that you have never used R and are self-standing lessons. Go to the <a href = "https://github.com/cimentadaj/Rseminars" target = "_blank"> Github</a> repository: follow the instructions and you'll be able to install everything and follow the courses.  <i>Note: Ignore the first lesson since it was a live presentation.</i>

- I gave a short course at Pompeu Fabra University introducing the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). I uploaded the syllabus online (program, slides and exercises) in my [Github](https://github.com/cimentadaj/tidyverse_seminars).

- I gave a talk at [PyData 2017](https://pydata.org/barcelona2017/) to introduce the tidyverse to follow data analysts. If you're interested, I uploaded the material in my [Github](https://github.com/cimentadaj/PyData_2017).
